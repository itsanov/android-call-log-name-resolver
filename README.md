# android-call-log-name-resolver

I built this background service because the recent call log on my full Android 7.0 smartwatch phone only showed numbers.
It monitors for the call log entries added by the phone application and appends a name from the contacts.
If you have a smartwatch with Android 7.0, you can install the APK located in the app/release folder, or build the project yourself.
After installing the application, you must manually grant permissions from AppManager.
